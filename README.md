# ML_Assignment

this project uses the CS:GO round winner classification dataset available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christianlillelund/csgo-round-winner-classification  
to run the project, install the dataset as .csv and place it in the same file as 'machine_learning_assignment.ipynb' before running the jupyter notebook.  

The goal of the assignment was to try out different classification algorithms, find their results and document them. I've used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a random forest. The random forest model scored the highest out of the three with an accuracy of 83%.
