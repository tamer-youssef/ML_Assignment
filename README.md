# ML_Assignment
The goal of the assignment was to apply different classification algorithms on the dataset of our choice, then compare their performance and document the results. I used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Random Forest to predict the winner of a round of Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The Random Forest model scored the highest results out of the three with an accuracy of 83%.  

### How to run the project
This project uses the CS:GO round winner classification dataset available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christianlillelund/csgo-round-winner-classification. To run the project, install the dataset as .csv and place it in the same file as 'machine_learning_assignment.ipynb' before running the jupyter notebook.
